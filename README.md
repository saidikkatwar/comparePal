# ComparePal
`Mini Project for comparing devices `

### Technology Stack: 

1. Node js
2. React js
3. MongoDB
4. Puppeteer
5. Express js

### Problem Statement:

> Due to tendency of humans to compare anything they buy so that the money spend should be worth off,
> we tend to waste a lot of time in deciding the factors which set the devices apart, to solve this problem,
> we seek to create a webApp which, when prompted gives detailed information about devices as well as their
> ratings from trusted E-commerce websites in a single page rather than exploring various websites.
